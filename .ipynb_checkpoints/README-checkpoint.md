# python-intro
Hello everyone!

If you are new to programing or just trying to get a better understanding of the Python programming language, these notebooks are for you! The notebooks walk though what we want to do and how to get it done in Python. If you find any other helpful tip that may help other feel free to push that code.

## Python and Notebooks Installation
This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks to follow along with the lectures. However, there are several packages and applications that need to be installed. It is recommended to install Anaconda at (https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

If you are new to Anaconda you can view the notebook at 
[Anaconda](Anaconda.ipynb)

## Install Git
Follow the instructions at (https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

## Run Notebooks
1. Clone the repository to a desired location (E.g. `https://github.com/stang84/python-intro`)
2. Open up jupyter labs or jupyter notebook either though anaconda navigator or terminal. 
3. Go to the repository directory
