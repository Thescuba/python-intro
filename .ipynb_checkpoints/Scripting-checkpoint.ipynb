    "1. Prepare to Use Command Line\n",
    "To install Python and follow this lesson, you will need to use the command line. We will walk you through all the details, so don't worry if you have never used it before! If you would like to learn or refresh on command lines, we strongly recommend going through this free [Shell Workshop lesson](https://www.udacity.com/course/shell-workshop--ud206), where you can set up and learn how to use Unix Shell commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "** Note to Windows Users: Install Git Bash\n",
    "As noted in the free Shell Workshop linked above, we recommend you install Git Bash [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and use this as your terminal for this lesson. Please note that during installation you should select the checkbox Use Git and Optional Unix tools from the Windows Command Prompt. This will allow you to use Unix commands while in Windows. If you'd rather use PowerShell, those commands are also provided in this lesson. For more information on the different command shells, check out the Shell Workshop lesson linked above.\n",

    "2. Is Python Already Installed On Your Computer?\n",
    "In this course, we're using the most recent major version of Python - Python 3. Although Python 2 is still being used in many places, it is no longer being updated. In order to keep up compatibility with future improvements to Python, we recommend using Python 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mac OS X and Linux usually come with Python 2 already installed. We DO NOT recommend that you make any changes to this Python, since parts of the operating system are using Python. However, it shouldn't do any harm to your system to install Python 3 separately, too.\n",

    "\n",
    "If you are interested in learning Python for data science, we strongly recommend installing Anaconda, even if you already have Python installed on your computer. You should install Python 3.6 for courses at Udacity. Having a dual environment with two different versions of Python can be useful, but content across all of our courses, and most professional environments, has now been converted to the newest version of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anaconda includes a great distribution of libraries and software built for data science, some of which are otherwise difficult to install. It also makes it really easy to [set up different environments](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) on your computer so you can quickly switch between different versions of Python and packages! For example, if one project you're working on requires Python 2.7 and another requires Python 3.6, as well as different dependencies, then Anaconda's environment management can help.\n",

Let's explain what is happening, the first time we run the code we seem to have forgotten the ending <code>'</code> on our string. Python tells us that we have a syntax error meaning python can't understand what we wanted it to do. This is a simple fix and we just close off our string and everything works find when we run it again. When we run the ValueError portion of the code we see that the literal <code>'ten'</code> can be converted to an <code>int</code>. There was nothing wrong with our syntax but we do run into an exception because the string spelling out 'ten' is not a valid argument for the <code>int()</code> function. The last example we have with the NameError exception we see that our code is syntactically correct but we get to a variable in which we have yet to assign and python is unable to find the value so it raises an exception and stops the code."
