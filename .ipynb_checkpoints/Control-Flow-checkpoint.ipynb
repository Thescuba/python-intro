The user wants to make sure that they always have funds so they want the app to automatically transfer funds from their bank account to there mobile wallet when they have less than $5 in credit. This can easily be done in code using an <code>if</code> statement. An <code>if</code> statement is a conditional statement that runs or skips code based on whether a condition is true or false.
