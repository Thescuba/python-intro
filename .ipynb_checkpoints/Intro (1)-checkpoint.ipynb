    "I have created this ntoebook with the hopes that anyone who is new to python will be able to understand quickly and effiectly how it works. I will be going over good python practices and also how some common erros may occur along with solutions on how to debug. We will first go over the topic with some basic examples along the way, and each section should have a small quiz section.\n",

    "To help see what our code is doing we will be using pythons built in print function to displacy our results. To use print we will type print followed by parentheses, another cool feature is that we can print out a statement followed by out results. To make reading mathamatical forumals easier we can choose to add more spacing as seen in the first example below, the addition opperator will come after the multiplcation so we choose to space out 1 and 2 while keeping 3 and 4 tight.
