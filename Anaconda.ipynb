    "## Introduction\n",
    "Anaconda is a distribution of packages built for data science. It comes with conda, a package and environment manager. You'll be using conda to create environments for isolating your projects that use different versions of Python and/or different packages. You'll also use it to install, uninstall, and update packages in your environments. Using Anaconda has made my life working with data much more pleasant.\n",

    "Virtualenv allows users to separate libraries required by different projects allowing you to avoid conflicts. When your working with data, Anaconda is the way to go. Anaconda is a distribution of libraries and software specifically built for data science. It comes with conda, an environment manager that will make your life a thousand times better.\n",
